To run Java code through terminal
javac server\Main.java - To compile Main.java located in /server/ from root directory
-Otherwise javac Main.java 
java server.Main - Where server is the folder where Main.class is located(and has the package 'server') 
-Otherwise java Main

To compile Java files for separate the .class files:
javac -d bin src/foo/bar/*.java
-Where 'bin' is where you want the .class files to located(from current directory)
-Where 'src/foo/bar/*.java' would be where all the java files located in the src/foo/bar folder

To run the Java files:
java -cp bin
-Where 'bin' is where all the .class files are located in from the current root directory

-Use Maven?
